I765 processing time

Students under the F-1 visa usually apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) to get work authorization from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for internships / jobs. It is also the ultimate test of one's patience. Even after one has braved the inane paperworks and countless trips to advisors / international student offices, one would still have to wait up to 90 days for the authorization approval. What makes this wait worse is the lack of updates during the wait. When one applies for OPT (and the application is received by USCIS), one gets a receipt number. Using this receipt number to check one's progress (at https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/mycasestatus.do) is highly unsatisfying. Until the work authorization is approved (or God forbid rejected / put on hold for additional evidence), one is faced with rather useless description that reads something like this:

    'On February 22, 2016, we received your Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization , Receipt Number EAC1690120079, and sent you the receipt notice that describes how we will process your case. Please follow the instructions in the notice. If you do not receive your receipt notice by March 23, 2016, please call Customer Service at 1-800-375-5283. If you move, go to www.uscis.gov/addresschange to give us your new mailing address.'

USCIS does a really bad job of keeping one updated on the progress of a case and in general how far along they are going with the entire year's batch of students.

Fortunately, we can do better.
